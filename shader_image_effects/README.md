# Raycasting and UI

## What?

This demonstration shows how to use Raycasts to color 3D gameobjects based on what the user's mouse is hovering over. It also demonstrates how to translate from 3 dimensional space to 2D UI Canvas space, which is useful for creating tooltips, healbars, and other UI elements that track scene-space gameobjects.
